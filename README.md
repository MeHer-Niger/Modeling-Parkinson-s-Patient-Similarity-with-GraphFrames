# Parkinsonâ€™s Patient Similarity Graph Analysis using GraphFrames

This project explores Parkinson's telemonitoring data by modeling patient similarity as a graph using Apache Spark and GraphFrames. Patients are connected based on similar motor UPDRS scores to discover influential patients and communities.

## ðŸ©º Project Highlights

- Constructs a graph where nodes represent patients.
- Edges connect patients with motor_UPDRS scores differing by less than 2.
- Applies PageRank to identify influential patients.
- Merges graph results with patient metadata (age, sex).
- Visualizes patient similarity network with NetworkX.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- Python
- Apache Spark
- GraphFrames
- Pandas
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Download the dataset: `parkinsons_telemonitoring.csv`
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib networkx
